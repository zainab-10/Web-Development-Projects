With a modest beginning in 1952 as a "constituent" college of Peshawar University, UET, Peshawar was established in 1980. Located in this histroic city, Peshawar Campus is a reflection of the surrounding environment. While the ambiance on campus is predominantly academic, there is a strong cultural flavor, easily discernable in every facet of its activities. Our unique cultural diversity is readily recognizable. There are many disciplines at Peshawar for students to choose from. These are supported by well-equipped laboratories, departmental research, central library, sports facilities and enough dormitory accommodation to house most students that need campus housing.</p>
