<h1> <b>Department Of Agricultural Engineering <b> </h1>
<p>
The Department of Agricultural Engineering was established in 1961 in the then College of Engineering, University of Peshawar. This Department is the pioneer in initiating Agricultural Engineering education in the country and thus has the pride of producing the first batch of Agricultural Engineers in 1965 in Pakistan. Since then, hundreds of graduates of this department are rendering their valuable services in government departments, national and international organizations throughout the world. Our graduates have been instrumental in the development of Pakistan's economy. Agricultural Engineering is the branch of Engineering that utilizes the engineering principles, materials and forces of nature for the benefit of agriculture and resultantly in the best interest of humanity.

<h1> <b> Department Of Chemical Engineering </b></h1>
<p>
	Chemical Engineering is the branch of engineering, which blends the knowledge of basic sciences with engineering to develop, design, analyze and engineer the industrial processes and plants that turn raw materials into valuable products. These processes must be accomplished in safe, cost effective and sustainable manner to create products, which are useful and essential to the modern world. Chemical Engineering is based upon the fundamentals of mass, momentum, and heat transfer, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. Chemical Engineers are equipped with the necessary skills that encompass detailed understanding of all aspects of design, testing, scale-up, operation, control, and optimization of different unit operations.

<h1>
Department Of Mechatronics Engineering 
</h1>
<p>
Modern day machines increasingly incorporate electronics and microprocessors for intelligent control and increased efficiency such as electronic control of engines, computer control of machine tools, Robots, medical equipment and items of our daily life including automobiles, digital cameras, smart phones, tablets, DVD players and kitchen appliances. Design, production and operation of these machines require engineers with a knowledge base acquired form multi-engineering disciplines. Mechatronics Engineering is a relatively new but very exciting field that combines knowledge from the disciplines of Mechanical, Electronic and Computer Engineering.

Department Of Mechanical Engineering
</h1>
<p>
The knowledge of mechanical engineering is used to build useful products and devices for society. This can range from a device as small as a catheter injected into the human body, to a fax machine or printer, to a modern jet engine, to as large as a power plant for a major city.
Mechanical engineering encompasses the generation, conversion, transmission, and utilization of mechanical and thermal energy. This includes design, construction, and operation of all kinds of mechanical and thermal devices and systems.

<h1>Department Of Civil Engineering </h1>
<p>
The courses of study leading to the Degree of B.Sc. civil engineering have been planned to offer a broad spectrum of civil engineering subjects. The curriculum lays emphasis on subjects of structures, irrigation, geotechnical, transporatation engineering, environmental engineering and hydraulics. These courses include laboratory and design wrok. The prescribed syllabi and examination standards compare favorably with the standard of under-graduate work developed in UK, USA and Canada. In addition to course work, the final year students are required to work on a project under the guidance of senior faculty members.
